        <h3>Background and Education</h3>
        <p>I went to <a href="https://www.stjohns.edu/">St John's University</a> for pharmacy. I received a Doctor of Pharmacy degree and graduated with summa cum laude. I worked as a retail pharmacist for 12 years.</p>
        
        <p>I'm currently enrolled in <strong>Justice Through Code</strong> program in association with Columbia University. I'm thoroughly enjoying the classes as we learn about writing cover letters, preparing for interviews, and designing websites while learning basic <em>HTML, CSS,</em> and <em>Javascript</em> skills.</p>
        <p>To keep me focused on my path, I'm reminded of this quote by Norman Vincent Peale:
            <strong><q style="color:darkblue">Shoot for the moon. Even if you miss, you'll land among the stars.</q></strong>
